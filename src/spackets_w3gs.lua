    Remarks:       This is received when you are downloading a map from the host.

                   You can calculate how many more chunks you have left based on the file
                   size and the chunk position in file. You are done downloading when the
                   chunk position in file (plus the size of the chunk) matches the file
                   size received in 0x42 W3GS_MAPSIZE.

                   If the data does not match the CRC-32, you should send the host 0x45
                   W3GS_MAPPARTNOTOK, otherwise you should always send 0x44
                   W3GS_MAPPARTOK in reply to this packet.

                   (WORD) CRC-16 encryption

                   For each action:

                   (WORD) Length of action data

    Remarks:       Informs the client about an action in-game.

                   This is used when there is not enough room inside 0x0C

                     the process' memory, including sensitive information such as your
                     CDKey.

    Format:          (STRING) Text

    Remarks:         Very simply prints out text with the string at 1903B9FBh (the default
                     string, used anyway if the username field is NULL in the chat event
                     struct -- currently a single 0x7F char) as the username.

                     Used to send announcements and arbitrary messages to the user, but
                     this was soon superseded by SID_CHAT subcommands such as EID_INFO,
                     EID_ERROR, and EID_BROADCAST. Printed out with the same color and
                     style as an EID_BROADCAST.

                     by the server.

                     Not used because it was quickly discovered that storing preferences
                     produces less problems and were faster by storing them server-side,
