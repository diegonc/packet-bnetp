    Remarks:       This message is sent to inform the server that a game should no longer
                   be advertised to other users. It is sent when a game starts, or when a
                   game is aborted (the host leaves).

                   All Battle.snp clients (DRTL, DSHR, STAR/SEXP, JSTR, SSHR, and W2BN)
                   always send this message when logging off, even if it not in a game.

    Message Name:  SID_CLIENTID

    Direction:     Client -> Server (Sent)

    Used By:       Starcraft Shareware, Diablo Shareware, Warcraft II, Starcraft Japanese

    Format:        (DWORD) Registration Version
                   (DWORD) Registration Authority
                   (DWORD) Account Number
                   (DWORD) Registration Token
                   (STRING) LAN Computer Name
                   (STRING) LAN Username

    Remarks:       This packet was used to ensure that the client's account number was
                   valid. All but the last two fields in this message are now ignored,
                   and may be set to zero.

                   The 'LAN Computer Name' field is the NetBIOS name of the computer. It
                   can be retrieved using the GetComputerName API.

                   The 'Lan Username' field is the name of the currently logged on user,
                   and may be retrieved using the GetUsername API.

                   The following information is historical:

                   The client would supply this data as issued by a Battle.net server. If
                   the Registration Version, Registration Authority, and Client Token
                   values equated to the account number supplied (Client ID), as
                   determined by an unknown formula, the server would respond with the
                   same values. If they were invalid, the server would assign new values.
                   Registration Version was always 1, Authority was the IP address of the
                   server that issued the account number. Thus, the Client Token was the
                   secret value, used to prove that the client really owned the account
                   in question.

    Remarks:         Retrieves a list of games.

                     Condition 1:

                     For STAR/SEXP/SSHR/JSTR and W2BN, Condition 1 is used to specify
                     a game type. A value of 0 indicates that any type is acceptable.

                     Possible game types:
                     0x00: All

                     0x02: Melee

                     0x03: Free for all

                     0x04: one vs one

                     0x05: CTF

                     0x06: Greed

                     0x07: Slaughter

                     0x08: Sudden Death

                     0x09: Ladder

                     0x10: Iron man ladder

                     0x0A: Use Map Settings

                     0x0B: Team Melee

                     0x0C: Team FFA

                     0x0D: Team CTF

                     0x0F: Top vs Bottom
                     For DRTL/DSHR, Condition 1 is used to specify a 'level range'.
                     This ensures that clients receive a list of games containing
                     players whose experience is similar to their own.

                     Possible ranges:
                     0x00: Level 1

                     0x01: 2 - 3

                     0x02: 4 - 5

                     0x03: 6 - 7

                     0x04: 8 - 9

                     0x05: 10 - 12

                     0x06: 13 - 16

                     0x07: 17 - 19

                     0x08: 20 - 24

                     0x09: 25 - 29

                     0x0A: 30 - 34

                     0x0B: 35 - 39

                     0x0C: 40 - 47

                     0x0D: 48 - 50

                     For all other games, this can be set to 0x00.

                     Condition 2:

                     Unknown. Set to 0x00.

                     Condition 3:

                     For STAR/SEXP/SSHR/JSTR, Condition 3 is set to 0x30. For
                     DRTL/DSHR, Condition 3 is set to 0xFFFF by the game, but setting
                     it to 0x00 will disable any viewing limitations, letting you
                     view all games.

                     Condition 4:

                     Unknown. Set to 0x00.

                     List count:

                     By default, DRTL/DSHR set this to 0x19. This is the number of
                     games to list. For a full listing, it's safe to use 0xFF.

                   (STRING) Channel

    Remarks:       Joins a channel after entering chat.
                   The flags field may contain the following values:
                   0x00: NoCreate join
                   0x01: First join
                   0x02: Forced join
                   0x05: D2 first join

                   NoCreate Join:
                   This will only join the channel specified if it is not empty,
                   and is used by clients when selecting a channel from the
                   channels menu. If the channel is empty, Battle.net sends a
                   SID_CHATEVENT of type EID_CHANNELDOESNOTEXIST, upon which
                   official clients prompt for confirmation that the user wishes to
                   create the channel, in which case, it resends this packet with
                   Flags set to Forced Join (0x02).

                   First Join:
                   Places user in a channel starting with their product and
                   country, followed by a number, ie 'Brood War GBR-1'. Also
                   automatically sends MOTD after entering the channel. When using
                   this type, the Channel variable has no effect, but must be
                   present anyway to avoid an IP ban. This is sent when first
                   logging onto Battle.net

                   Forced Join:
                   This is sent when leaving a game, and joins the specified
                   channel without an supplying an MOTD.

                   D2 First Join:
                   The same as First join, but is used for D2DV/D2XP clients.

    Remarks:         Used by clients to inform the server that a game has been created, or
                     that the state of a created game has changed.

                     Bitwise flags for State:
                     0x01: Game is private

                     0x02: Game is full

                     0x04: Game contains players (other than creator)

                     0x08: Game is in progress

                     Possible values for Game Type:
                     0x02: Melee

                     0x03: Free for All

                     0x04: 1 vs 1

                     0x09: Ladder

                     0x0A: Use Map Settings

                     0x0F: Top vs Bottom

                     0x10: Iron Man Ladder (W2BN only)

                     Possible values for Ladder:
                     0x00: Game is NonLadder

                     0x01: Game is Ladder

                     0x03: Game is Iron Man Ladder (W2BN only)

                     It could be that the ladder is bitwise as well, and that 0x02 means
                     Iron Man and 0x03 just means Iron Man + Ladder.

                     Parameter appears to be 1 for all games except Top vs Bottom, where it
                     seems to depend on the size of each team. More research will be needed
                     to confirm.

    Remarks:       Contains Client's username & hashed password.

                   Battle.net password hashes are hashed twice. First, the password is
                   hashed by itsself, then the following data is hashed again and sent to
                   Battle.net:

                   Client Token
                   Server Token
                   First password hash (20 bytes)

                   Passwords should be converted to lower case before hashing.

                   This packet is identical to SID_CREATEACCOUNT2, but the response is
                   limited to success/fail. Developers who wish to provide a reason for
                   account creation failure should use SID_CREATEACCOUNT2.

                   Currently, SID_CREATEACCOUNT2 may be used with any product, but the
                   protocol-correct packet to use depends on the product you are
                   emulating.

                   back to the client by Battle.net and do not seem to affect the reply.
                   Because of this it is reasonable to assume that first DWORD at least
                   is a request ID of some kind. This is called into question, however,
                   by the fact that the replying packet also contains the requested
                   filename. The game (STAR/SEXP) always sends the same number in DWORD 1

                   (STRING) Filename

    Remarks:       Verifies that a file is authentic, by producing a hash of that file
                   and sending it to the server for comparison to the original.

                   The hash is produced by hashing 64-byte chunks of the file. Each time
                   after the first, the result of the previous hash is used to initialize
                   & complete the current hash. The final chunk, which may be less than
                   64 bytes in length, is included in the operation.

    Remarks:       Requests news and MOTD from battle.net.

                   The news timestamp specifies the starting date for the news. To
                   retrieve all available news entries, set this to zero. Timestamps are
                   given in C/Unix format -- that is, the number of seconds since January
                   1, 1970 0:00:00.000 -- and should be biased to UTC.

                   This message should be sent when you receive SID_ENTERCHAT. The
                   official client stops processing messages after the user joins a game
                   or enters a channel, and discards messages with more than 127 entries.

                   News can be requested for older products, but Battle.net will only
                   return the server's Message-of-the-Day. However, this behavior has not
                   been observed in official clients, and for an accurate protocol
                   emulation, its use is not recommended.

                   Length:

                   This data is based on a 1024-byte buffer. The call to ExtraWork
                   takes in a structure and returns the length and buffer based on

                   *These fields can be set to zero without breaking logon.

                   Protocol ID:

                   Battle.net's current Protocol ID is 0.

                   Platform ID:

                   A DWORD specifying the client's platform (IX86, PMAC, XMAC,
                   etc).

                   Product ID:

                   A DWORD specifying the client's game.

                   Version:

                   The client's version byte.

                   Product Language:

                   This field is under investigation. It can safely be set to 0.

                   MPQ Locale ID:

                   This field is part of Blizzards multi-lingual MPQ system. Is
                   used to specify which version of an MPQ should be used when the
                   MPQ is available in multiple languages.

                   Local IP:

                   This is the local network IP of the client, in network byte
                   order.

                   Timezone bias:

                   The difference, in minutes, between UTC and local time. The
                   client calculates this value by subtracting the Local Time from
                   the System Time, having converted both to Filetime structures,
                   and then converting the resultant offset to minutes by diving it
                   by 600,000,000. If you wish to understand the mechanism
                   involved, read Microsoft's documentation on File times.

                   Language ID, Country Abbreviation, and Country:

                   These values can be retrieved by querying the system's locale
                   information.

                   Language ID can be retrieved using the GetUserDefaultLangID API.
                   Country Abbreviation & Country can be retrieved using the
                   GetLocaleInfo API to request the LOCALE_SABBREVCTRYNAME and

                     Salt and Verifier values as seen in SID_AUTH_ACCOUNTCREATE.

                     Old Password is the account's current password. The New Password can
                     be the same as the Old Password, but it can be used to change the

                     one, and thus become NLS. However, this packet is no longer responded
                     to, and upgrading accounts is therefore impossible.(Note: If you have
