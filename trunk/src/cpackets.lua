    Remarks:       This message is empty and may be used to keep the connection alive.
                   The client is not required to send this. There is no response from the
                   server.

                   If the connection to the BNLS server is idle for more than one minute,
                   the BNLS server will disconnect the client. To avoid that, use this
                   message.

                     (DWORD) Flags
                     (VOID) Data to be hashed.
                     Optional:
                     (DWORD) Client Key
                     (Double Hash only)(DWORD) Server Key
                     (Double Hash only)(DWORD) Cookie (Cookie Hash only)

    Remarks:         This message will calculate the hash of the given data.
                     The hashing algorithm used is the Battle.net standard hashing
                     algorithm also known as "Broken SHA-1"

                     The flags may be zero, or any bitwise combination of the defined
                     flags.
                     Currently, the following flags are defined:

                     0x01: Flags Unused
                     This flag has no effect.

                     0x02: Double Hash
                     If this flag is present, the server will calculate a double hash.
                     First it will calculate the hash of the data. Then it will prepend the
                     client key and the server key to the resulting hash, and calculate the
                     hash of the result. If this flag is present, the client key and server
                     key DWORDs must be specified in the request after the data.
                     This may be used to calculate password hashes for the "Old Logon
                     System".

                     0x04: Cookie Hash
                     If this flag is present, a cookie DWORD is specified in the request.
                     This is an application-defined value that is echoed back to the client
                     in the response.

                     CDKEY_SAME_SESSION_KEY (0x01):
                     This flag specifies that all the returned CD-keys will use the same
                     client session key. When used in combination with
                     CDKEY_GIVEN_SESSION_KEY (0x02), a single client session key is
                     specified immediately after the server session key(s). When used

                     sent in the request, and the server will create one.
                     When not used, each CD-key gets its own client session key. This flag

                     CDKEY_GIVEN_SESSION_KEY (0x02):
                     This flag specifies that the client session keys to be used are
                     specified in the request. When used in combination with
                     CDKEY_SAME_SESSION_KEY (0x01), a single client session key is
                     specified immediately after the server session key(s). When used
                     without CDKEY_SAME_SESSION_KEY (0x01), an array of client session keys
                     (as many as the amount of CD-keys) is specified. When not used, client
                     session keys aren't included in the request.

                     CDKEY_MULTI_SERVER_SESSION_KEYS (0x04):
                     This flag specifies that each CD-key has its own server session key.
                     When specified, an array of server session keys (as many as the amount
                     of CD-keys) is specified. When not specified, a single server session
                     key is specified.
                     This flag has no effect if the amount of CD-keys to encrypt is 1.

                     CDKEY_OLD_STYLE_RESPONSES (0x08):

                     (0x01) responses, instead of a BNLS_CDKEY_EX (0x0c) response. The
                     responses are guaranteed to be in the order of the CD-keys' appearance
                     in the request. Note that when this flag is specified, the Cookie
                     cannot be echoed. (It must still be included in the request.)

                     Note: When using Lord of Destruction, two CD-keys are encrypted, and
                     they must share the same client session key. There are several ways to
                     do this. One way is to provide both CD-keys in this packet, using the
                     flag CDKEY_SAME_SESSION_KEY (0x01). Another way is to use BNLS_CDKEY
                     (0x01) to encrypt the first CD-key, then use this packet with the flag
                     CDKEY_GIVEN_SESSION_KEY (0x02) to encrypt the second CD-key with the
                     same client session key. Related Links: [S>0x01] BNLS_CDKEY, [S>0x0C]

    Remarks:         This message logs on to the BNLS server.

                     Note: The bot ID is not case sensitive, and is limited to 31
                     characters.

                     This message was used to let your bot log into the BNLS service. It is
                     no longer required. It may still be used, however. If you wish to
                     require your bot to login to BNLS to be able to work, you can change
                     your BNLS password and prevent your bot from logging in. Useful for
                     required patches and such.

                     To get a bot ID and password, ask Yoni or Skywing.

                     Note: As of June 28, 2004, BNLS IDs were no longer required to log
                     into BNLS; clients could completely bypass using messages
                     BNLS_AUTHORIZE and BNLS_AUTHORIZEPROOF to log on, and BNLS would
                     validate any client that logged in via these methods. On August 14,
                     2004, BNLS was again changed so that, while clients can still bypass
                     using messages BNLS_AUTHORIZE and BNLS_AUTHORIZEPROOF to log on,
                     clients that do support these messages will be validated against the
                     bot ID database, which allows those users who still own bot IDs to
                     disable old versions by changing the password on the account. Related

                     Both the slot indicies and the NLS revision number follow their
                     respective conventions covered in this documentation. The account
                     database data is first received from the client's
                     SID_AUTH_ACCOUNTCREATE (0x04) message. This information must be stored
                     by the server's account database for logon checking. If the account
                     database data is invalid, then the logon checking session will not
                     succeed.
                     This message initializes a slot with all the information required for
                     it to operate, including the NLS revision. Although BNLS supports
                     switching the NLS revision of a given slot, it can respond to requests
                     slightly faster if the same NLS revision is used for the same slots in

                     This is purely speculation, but as there are 5 unknown DWORDs at the
                     end of this chunk, it is possible that it is actually a hash of
                     something.

                   Character Classes are the same as in D2 users' Statstrings:

                   0x00: Amazon 0x01: Sorceress 0x02: Necromancer 0x03: Paladin

                   Flag values should be OR'd together. The only flags that can be set
                   for character creation are classic, hardcore, expansion, and ladder,
                   but the other flags are included here for completeness:

                   0x00: Classic
                   0x04: Hardcore

                   character flags while on D2DV will disconnect and temporarily
                   ban you from the realm. Likewise, sending 0x05 or 0x06 in
                   character class without setting 0x20 in character flags will
                   result in a disconnect and ban.

    Format:        (DWORD) Code

    Remarks:       This message is used to determine the latency to a game on Battle.net.

                   If code is zero, then the message is a ping request from another
                   client (and this client should respond with a PKT_CLIENTREQ using a
                   non-zero code). Otherwise, the message is a ping response.

                   In previous versions of UDP enabled clients they would use
                   GetTickCount() as the return value (the recieving end would then do
                   math on that value to get the latency).
                   Clients now use 0x01 for the value and do all the math locally, this
                   resolves time zone issues and other stuffs.

                   and may be set to zero.

                   The 'LAN Computer Name' field is the NetBIOS name of the computer. It
                   can be retrieved using the GetComputerName API.

                   and may be retrieved using the GetUsername API.

                   The following information is historical:

                   The client would supply this data as issued by a Battle.net server. If
                   the Registration Version, Registration Authority, and Client Token
                   values equated to the account number supplied (Client ID), as
                   determined by an unknown formula, the server would respond with the
                   same values. If they were invalid, the server would assign new values.
                   Registration Version was always 1, Authority was the IP address of the
                   server that issued the account number. Thus, the Client Token was the
                   secret value, used to prove that the client really owned the account
                   in question.

                     For DRTL/DSHR, Condition 1 is used to specify a 'level range'.
                     This ensures that clients receive a list of games containing
                     players whose experience is similar to their own.

                     Possible ranges:
                     0x00: Level 1

                     0x01: 2 - 3

                     0x02: 4 - 5

                     0x03: 6 - 7

                     0x04: 8 - 9

                     0x05: 10 - 12

                     0x06: 13 - 16

                     0x07: 17 - 19

                     0x08: 20 - 24

                     0x09: 25 - 29

                     0x0A: 30 - 34

                     0x0B: 35 - 39

                     0x0C: 40 - 47

                     0x0D: 48 - 50

                     For all other games, this can be set to 0x00.

                     Condition 2:

                     Unknown. Set to 0x00.

                     Condition 3:

                     For STAR/SEXP/SSHR/JSTR, Condition 3 is set to 0x30. For
                     DRTL/DSHR, Condition 3 is set to 0xFFFF by the game, but setting
                     it to 0x00 will disable any viewing limitations, letting you
                     view all games.

                     Condition 4:

                     Unknown. Set to 0x00.

                     List count:

                     By default, DRTL/DSHR set this to 0x19. This is the number of
                     games to list. For a full listing, it's safe to use 0xFF.

                   (STRING) Channel

    Remarks:       Joins a channel after entering chat.
                   The flags field may contain the following values:
                   0x00: NoCreate join
                   0x01: First join
                   0x02: Forced join
                   0x05: D2 first join

                   NoCreate Join:
                   This will only join the channel specified if it is not empty,
                   and is used by clients when selecting a channel from the
                   channels menu. If the channel is empty, Battle.net sends a
                   SID_CHATEVENT of type EID_CHANNELDOESNOTEXIST, upon which
                   official clients prompt for confirmation that the user wishes to
                   create the channel, in which case, it resends this packet with
                   Flags set to Forced Join (0x02).

                   First Join:
                   Places user in a channel starting with their product and
                   country, followed by a number, ie 'Brood War GBR-1'. Also
                   automatically sends MOTD after entering the channel. When using
                   this type, the Channel variable has no effect, but must be
                   present anyway to avoid an IP ban. This is sent when first
                   logging onto Battle.net

                   Forced Join:
                   This is sent when leaving a game, and joins the specified
                   channel without an supplying an MOTD.

                   D2 First Join:
                   The same as First join, but is used for D2DV/D2XP clients.

                     0x01: Game is Ladder

                     0x03: Game is Iron Man Ladder (W2BN only)

                     It could be that the ladder is bitwise as well, and that 0x02 means
                     Iron Man and 0x03 just means Iron Man + Ladder.

                     Parameter appears to be 1 for all games except Top vs Bottom, where it
                     seems to depend on the size of each team. More research will be needed

                   Battle.net password hashes are hashed twice. First, the password is

                   First password hash (20 bytes)

    Remarks:       This packet seems to request the current filetime for the specified
                   file. Purpose of first 2 DWORDs is unknown, however, both are echoed
                   back to the client by Battle.net and do not seem to affect the reply.
                   Because of this it is reasonable to assume that first DWORD at least
                   is a request ID of some kind. This is called into question, however,
                   by the fact that the replying packet also contains the requested
                   filename. The game (STAR/SEXP) always sends the same number in DWORD 1
                   for the file in question. DWORD 2 seems to be null.

    Remarks:       Sends information about the Client to Battle.net.

                   *These fields can be set to zero without breaking logon.

                   Protocol ID:

                   Battle.net's current Protocol ID is 0.

                   Platform ID:

                   A DWORD specifying the client's platform (IX86, PMAC, XMAC,
                   etc).

                   Product ID:

                   A DWORD specifying the client's game.

                   Version:

                   The client's version byte.

                   Product Language:

                   This field is under investigation. It can safely be set to 0.

                   MPQ Locale ID:

                   This field is part of Blizzards multi-lingual MPQ system. Is
                   used to specify which version of an MPQ should be used when the
                   MPQ is available in multiple languages.

                   Local IP:

                   This is the local network IP of the client, in network byte
                   order.

                   Timezone bias:

                   The difference, in minutes, between UTC and local time. The
                   client calculates this value by subtracting the Local Time from
                   the System Time, having converted both to Filetime structures,
                   and then converting the resultant offset to minutes by diving it
                   by 600,000,000. If you wish to understand the mechanism
                   involved, read Microsoft's documentation on File times.

                   Language ID, Country Abbreviation, and Country:

                   These values can be retrieved by querying the system's locale
                   information.

                   Language ID can be retrieved using the GetUserDefaultLangID API.
                   Country Abbreviation & Country can be retrieved using the
                   GetLocaleInfo API to request the LOCALE_SABBREVCTRYNAME and
                   LOCALE_SENGCOUNTRY, respectively.
